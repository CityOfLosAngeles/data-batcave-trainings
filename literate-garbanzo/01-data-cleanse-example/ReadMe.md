# Identify and Remove Duplicate Records
# Utilize the Pandas library to find and remove duplicate records from a CSV file

---
These scripts identify duplicate records and create a "clean" file where duplicates are removed.

1. duplicates_find - creates a CSV file from the input file containing only the duplicate records
2. duplicates_remove - removes the duplicate records from the input file using CSV module and Pandas

Input and output files are found in Resources

### Talking Points

### TO DO

* Make process more object oriented with conditional on the ```python pd.concat``` object.
