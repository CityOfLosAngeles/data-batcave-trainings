# Guide to Python Data Viz Demonstration

# Process

* Live code parts of 01-data-cleanse-example
* Live code sections of 02-plot-crimes
* Display complete code for 03-plot-calls-for-service
	* Only output PNG files are included in this 03 folder
	
## Objectives

* Understand conversion of CSV file to a dataframe
* Understand use of conditionals and looping
* Examine methods for data cleansing and discuss importance of doing so
* Discuss value of normalizing data sets
* Review Python libraries such as matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn for visualizing data
* Be able to run .ipynb files from Jupyter Notebook
* Be able to run .py files from Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac)



## Requirements
### Necessary if attendees want to run programs
* Python 3.6.x 64-bit from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
* Jupyter [Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html) (typically installed with Anaconda)
* Optionally [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

* Download or `clone` the [repository](https://github.com/CityOfLosAngeles/data-batcave-trainings)
    * With SSH key `git clone git@github.com:CityOfLosAngeles/data-batcave-trainings.git`
    * no SSH key? try `git clone https://github.com/CityOfLosAngeles/data-batcave-trainings.git`
#### Matplotlib Install Reference
* From within virtual enivornment enter command: `python -mpip install --upgrade matplotlib`
    * This will update your matplotlib version so it works better with the code
    * Optionally users can run command from local machine with command: `pip install --upgrade matplotlib`
    * confirm version `print(mpl.__version__)`
